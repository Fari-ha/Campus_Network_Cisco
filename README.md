# Campus Network Project

Welcome to the Campus Network Project! 

Establishing a strong and extensive network infrastructure that smoothly links every department on campus is the main goal of this project.
Cisco Packet Tracer was used to construct this project. The configuration consists of five departments, each of which has eight PCs, three laptops, two servers, five switches, five routers, and two printers connected via IPv4 addressing.

# Project Design

Each component that makes up the network serves a distinct purpose within the network. The following is a description of the main parts:

End Devices: A variety of gadgets, including computers, printers, and laptops, are utilized to build networks that resemble the actual world.

Routers: By sending data packets between networks, these devices link two or more networks and control network traffic.

Switches: A networking device that joins several devices in a local network by linking them together.

Servers: Centralized resources for processing, storing, or hosting applications.

# IPv4 addressing technique

A system's network interface can be uniquely identified by its 32-bit IPv4 address. 
Decimal digits are used to express IPv4 addresses, which are divided into four 8-bit fields and separated by periods. The TCP/IP suite of protocols, which includes IP as the foundational set of guidelines for Internet communication, is comprised of TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). The network layer identifier used to identify every device connected to the Internet is called an IP address, or Internet address.

# Application

To become familiar with IPv4 addressing, learn how to set up different Cisco Packet Tracer components, and construct a network.

Cisco Packet Tracer: To inspect the network and make changes to it according to your needs, open the project file in Cisco Packet Tracer.

Configuration: Examine the server, switch, and router configurations to comprehend the network architecture.

Simulation: Check how messages are sent over the network, how devices communicate with one another, and how data moves over the network by using the simulation mode.
